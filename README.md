# CNN - Melanoma Detection


> Build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
- Data Reading/Data Understanding
- Dataset Creation
- Dataset visualisation
- Model Building & training : Base model 
- Model Building & training on the augmented data
- Handling class imbalances
- Model Building & training on the rectified class imbalance data 


## Conclusions
- Base model overfits
- Post data augmentation, the overfitting is solved but the accuracy is not improved
- Post handling class imbalance, the overfitting diminishes. Adding more layers and batch normalisation improved accuracy.

## Technologies Used
- python - version 3.7.13
- pandas - version 1.3.5
- numpy - version 1.21.6
- tensorflow - version 2.8.2
- keras - version 2.8.0
- scikit-learn - version 1.0.2
